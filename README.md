# Introduction

Cybersecurity is a subset of IT.

This is why it's important to have a strong foundation in system administration. Windows OS plays a crucial role in this foundation, as it is the most widely used operating system in business environments worldwide. Understanding Windows OS is key for effective system administration—it helps manage and protect critical infrastructure, support end-users, and drive automation and innovation. It's the backbone of business continuity and productivity.

In this project, I'll be covering the fundamentals of the Windows OS.

# Lab #1: Navigating the Windows Desktop

Let's start with the absolute basics of Windows OS. 

There are two ways to navigate Windows—through the Command Line Interface (CLI), or the Graphical User Interface (GUI). That being said, Windows is a "GUI-first" operating system. It makes navigating Windows systems accessible to a broader range of users (especially non-technical ones). 

Let's start by clicking the Windows icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen.

This opens the Start Menu, which is like Windows' central navigation hub.

This allows us to search for applications we want to use. Then we can simply select them to run them. For instance, we can select the ```copilot```application to run it.

Within this menu view, we can also pin items directly to the Start menu or taskbar for quick access. 

Right-click them to open up a context menu and pin to start.

Next we'll check out the taskbar, which is the bar at the bottom of the screen.

We can right-click it to open up another context menu. This allows us to access additional options such as changing taskbar setting or pinning open icons.

There are a lot of things we can do with the taskbar. 

For instance, we can quickly clear our current view by selecting "Show the desktop." I'll open up copilot to illustrate this.

<img width="750" alt="show the desktop" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8861fcc-583a-4e50-ba6c-2a13d3b3f43a">

This will close the open windows on the desktop.

We can go back to the context menu and select "show open windows" to bring the app back into desktop view.

We can also customize the taskbar by accessing the taskbar settings again, and adjusting options such as locking it in place or hiding it automatically.

This time we'll use the "Taskbar settings" to view these options.

Now we'll take a look at the file explorer tool. 

This is a common tool Windows users use to visually navigate all the files stored on the system.

We'll also take a look at the Control Panel.

This is where we can interact and change settings to our operating system. Use the search box to open it up.

<img width="750" alt="Control panel" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77e4089f-f9e3-412b-a5a7-4aa912fd3c63">

Notice how there's a centralized interface where we can adjust a wide range of system and hardware configurations.

That being said, there is a more modern view of this called Windows Settings.

We can view this by going to our Start menu, typing in "Settings," and selecting the app. 

<img width="750" alt="Windows settings" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6055b47-ff91-4109-84df-92cd7b67b2a7">

Notice the similarities with the Control Panel, yet with a more simple and modern view. 

This represents how, over time, Windows has tried to make their operating system more accessible and understandable to a broader range of users.

Next let's look at notifications by locating the Action Center, represented by a speech bubble icon on the bottom right of the taskbar.

<img width="750" alt="Action Center" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e4f847a-2287-4aa0-bfde-33266f95bf81">

After selecting it, a window will pop up with notifications and additional settings.

Now we'll look at how to open multiple "views" or "desktops" by finding the Task View button on the taskbar.

It's located to the right of the search box.

<img width="750" alt="Task View Icon" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99403856-89e0-448b-9fb7-5de6f97f0da9">

It's designed to segment work into distinct categories, reducing cognitive load and improving focus on specific tasks or projects.

We can demonstrate the power of this by opening up applications in different "views," which is just a another way of saying virtual desktops.

We can use Task View to manage multiple desktops and applications simultaneously for increased productivity.
